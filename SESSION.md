# SESSION.md

Handoff notes per CLAUDE.md §8. Newest session at the top.

## 2026-09-19 — increment 1.7

### Last milestone completed

Boot preloader (PRD §5.10, new section added this session).

- `src/components/BootPreloader.astro` — overlay markup and scoped styles.
- `src/scripts/boot-preloader.ts` — the sequence, split out to stay under the
  CLAUDE.md §5 200-line cap. Astro inlines it into the HTML rather than emitting
  a file, which is what we want: no extra request before the first frame.
- Mounted as the first child of `<body>` in `BaseLayout.astro`. `<body>` gained
  `tabindex="-1"` so focus can move there when the overlay is removed, with
  `body:focus { outline: none }` so it never shows a ring.

### Verified

Timing was checked by running the *built* script against a DOM stand-in in Node
(no browser automation in this repo, and adding one needs owner sign-off per §2):

- Greeting 5 × 1000ms → line 2 at 5000ms → roles 4 × 1250ms → line 3 at 10000ms
  → fade at 11200ms → removed from the DOM at 11700ms.
- `boot-seen` set, and `prefers-reduced-motion`, both remove the overlay at 0ms
  with no sequence.
- Build clean: 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 hints.
- Boot script 785 B gzipped against the 2.5 KB allowance. Page total 6.85 KB
  gzipped against the 40 KB cap.

### Bug caught and fixed before commit

The first version waited on `window.load` with no ceiling, so a single stalled
image or font would have left the overlay up forever with the dots spinning —
the site unreachable except by clicking to skip. There is now a 3000ms grace cap
after the 1200ms dwell: reveal happens regardless. Re-tested, reveals at 14200ms
on a load event that never fires.

### Still to eyeball in the browser

None of the below is verifiable from the build output — please look:

- The word swap at 150ms: is the upward slide too subtle or too much?
- Whether 10s before the hero feels right. It is a long hold on a first visit.
  Shortening the cycles is a one-line change in `BootPreloader.astro`.
- The overlay is `hidden` in markup and revealed by script, so on a slow
  connection the hero may flash before the overlay appears. Worth checking on a
  throttled connection.

### Open question carried forward

The owner chose "ship as specced, keep hero eager" on the LCP tension: PRD §8
targets LCP ≤ 2.0s, and the overlay covers the hero for ~11s on a first visit.
The hero image still loads eagerly behind it, so it is ready at reveal, but a
field LCP measurement will read the overlay, not the hero. Worth deciding
whether §8's target needs a carve-out for first-visit sessions.

## 2026-09-19 — increment 1.6

### Last milestone completed

Post-deploy metadata and alias fixes.

- `site: "https://rishi-ventrapragada.vercel.app"` added to `astro.config.mjs`.
  `BaseLayout.astro` derives canonical, `og:url` and `twitter:url` from one
  `canonical` const, so a custom domain later only needs `site` changed.
  Added `twitter:url`, `twitter:title`, `twitter:description`, which were missing.
- Live URL is now **https://rishi-ventrapragada.vercel.app** and serves increment 1.6.
- CLAUDE.md §4 gained the Lightning CSS rule: `animation-timeline` and
  `animation-range` must live in their own rule, never beside the `animation`
  shorthand. Authorized by the owner this session.

### The "old nav still in the DOM" report — root cause

Not a code bug. The source was already correct after increment 1.5; nothing was
re-deleted this session. `rishi-ventrapragada.vercel.app` was an **alias pinned to a
10-hour-old increment-1 deployment**, so it served pre-1.5 markup while
`portfolio-gamma-lake-gtndl2ey0m.vercel.app` served the current build. Fixed with
`vercel alias set <deployment> rishi-ventrapragada.vercel.app`.

**There is only one Vercel project.** It was renamed `portfolio` →
`rishi-ventrapragada` (ID `prj_R7zqnBIxWhGIUImcGAZJHWsQhWXN`). `vercel ls` prints each
deployment under the project name as it was at deploy time, which makes the history
look like two projects. `.vercel/project.json` still records the old
`"projectName":"portfolio"`; the ID is what matters and it matches.

**Takeaway:** after a push, verify the alias points at the new deployment. A green
Vercel build does not mean the vanity URL moved.

### Verified on production after this deploy

- canonical / `og:url` / `twitter:url` — all `https://rishi-ventrapragada.vercel.app/`.
- Zero `localhost:4321` occurrences.
- Zero occurrences of `Rishi ©`, `Portfolio 01`, `MMXXVI`, `CSE · Data Science`,
  `Hyderabad, IN`, `React · Astro · Supabase`, `KalaCart`, `Life OS`, `AEGIS`.
- Served nav is the single inert hamburger.
- Client JS on `/`: 5.6 KB gzipped (ClientRouter only), against the 40 KB budget.

### Note

`<title>` and `<meta name="description">` still contain "Building for the web",
"CSE Data Science" and "Supabase". That is page metadata in `src/pages/index.astro`,
not the deleted caption layer. The owner confirmed this copy stays as is.

## 2026-09-19 — increment 1.5

### Last milestone completed

Hero and nav simplification, on top of increment 1.

- Nav reduced to a single inert hamburger, top right, 64px hit area. The brand label,
  `PORTFOLIO 01 / MMXXVI` block and `CSE · DATA SCIENCE / HYDERABAD, IN` stack are gone.
- Hero Layer C (the three-line caption) removed entirely, along with its CSS, its
  `caption-fade` keyframes and the mobile scrim.
- Wordmark capped at `clamp(320px, 72vw, 1100px)` centred, 88vw under 640px. Measured
  72.0% width / 14.0% margins at 1440px.
- Hair crosses the lower 40.4% of the letters at 1440px and 40.6% at 375px.
- Hero image deliberately untouched: same binary, same rendered box (470x607 at 1440px).

Verified after the resize: dissolve still 1 → 0.689 → 0.378 → 0 over the first 40% with
blur 0 → 8px; reduced motion still opacity-only; no horizontal overflow at 375px.

### Watch out for

`animation-timeline` must stay in its own CSS rule. When it sits beside `animation` (or
in a rule the minifier can merge with that one), Lightning CSS folds it into the shorthand
as `animation: ... scroll(root)`, which browsers reject — the dissolve then silently stops
working with no build error. This already happened once. The `:where(.hero)` prefix on the
longhand rule in `Hero.astro` exists solely to prevent that merge.

### Doc edits this session

- PRD.md §5.1 rewritten for the hamburger-only nav.
- PRD.md §5.2 rewritten: two layers instead of three, the SVG wordmark approach and its
  ink-box viewBox, the 72vw/88vw caps, and the minifier constraint above.

## 2026-09-18 — increment 1

### Last milestone completed

Increment 1 (PRD §10.1) complete: repo, Astro 7 scaffold, tokens, BaseLayout, Nav,
Hero with scroll dissolve, projects placeholder, footer, dev accent toggle, Vercel deploy.

- Repo: https://github.com/rishi-ventrapragada/Portfolio
- Live (public): https://portfolio-gamma-lake-gtndl2ey0m.vercel.app
- Vercel project: `rishiventra/rishi-ventrapragada`, framework preset Astro, output `dist`.
- Build: `astro check` clean — 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 hints.
- Client JS on `/`: 5.6 KB gzipped (ClientRouter only) against the 40 KB budget in PRD §8.
  The React runtime chunk is emitted but never referenced, since no island exists yet.
- Hero image: 1342 KB source PNG → 51 KB / 110 KB WebP, well under the 250 KB LCP ceiling.

### Next milestone planned

Increment 2 (PRD §10.2): projects content collection with three entries
(KalaCart, Life OS, AEGIS), project tiles on Home per §5.3, `/projects` index.
Needs real copy and demo video assets from the owner before tiles can be honest —
PRD §7 lists both as `[TODO]`.

### Changes to governing docs

- CLAUDE.md §2 changed "Astro 6" → "Astro 7 (latest stable)", authorized by the owner
  in this session. The owner chose Astro 7.3.3 over 6.4.8 after I flagged that 7 is the
  current stable release. PRD.md never named a version, so it needed no edit.

### Open questions

- **Final accent** (PRD §11): crimson vs violet, to be decided by eye on the live site
  using the dev toggle. The toggle is removed once decided.
- **Résumé**: footer links to `/resume.pdf`, which does not exist yet. The link is
  labelled `[TODO]` until the file lands in `public/`.
- **Deployment Protection is ON** (`ssoProtection: all_except_custom_domains`), so every
  newly created `*.vercel.app` URL returns Vercel's login page instead of the site. Only the
  original alias `portfolio-gamma-lake-gtndl2ey0m.vercel.app` predates it and is public.
  Turn it off at Vercel → Project → Settings → Deployment Protection → Vercel Authentication
  → Disabled. I could not run `vercel project protection disable` — it was blocked here as a
  security-weakening action, so it needs the owner.
- **Pretty free URL**: ~~blocked~~ **RESOLVED in increment 1.6.**
  https://rishi-ventrapragada.vercel.app is live, public and serving the current build.
- **Custom domain** (PRD §11): not touched, and no domain was purchased or registered. The
  `.vercel.app` URLs are Vercel's free auto-generated ones. Owner adds any custom domain
  in the dashboard.
- **Hamburger menu**: the button is rendered `disabled` with `aria-expanded="false"`
  per PRD §5.1; behaviour is increment 6.
- **Firefox**: `animation-timeline: scroll()` is still behind a flag as of Firefox 152,
  so the rAF fallback in `Hero.astro` is the live path there. Worth eyeballing in Firefox.
